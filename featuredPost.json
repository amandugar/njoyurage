    "content": "<p>Simple, relaxing and peaceful. Something attached to as well as detached from its environment to offer the shelter before a silencing view. Filter Architecture had this brand out-of-the-box idea to construct a structure in a place that is all about nature but had its own requirement of a shelter for a rest. It is situated in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is rested on the mountain of Visocica, a mountain range that is 1974m above sea level. It is geographically a marvellous view that has its basic composition of common sedimentary rocks. It offers the perfect service of shelter to hikers who go that way and it has an untold harmony with the surrounding with a quite blend around. It is set between two mountains called Visocica and Bjelasnica. The landscape of the particular place offers an ideal stage for the cabin as it connects the two mountains and it is a very common route for hikers. The interior of the cabin has three platforms that acts as the bed, bench and floor areas. It can accommodate up to nine people who can sit on the benches facing each other. As filter architecture put it, &ldquo;the bivouac was built with very limited resources, under difficult high mountain conditions, but with enormous voluntary engagement and cooperation that would be impossible in a purely commercial context.&rdquo; The project had its ups and downs and mainly filled with challenges but at long last the result was a beauty to keep looking back at.</p>\r\n",

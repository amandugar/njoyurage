With many experiences and milestones already collected in your past, the New Year is a good time to take stock and see what shape your life and your legacy are taking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people view their legacy as something material - a house they built by hand or a building they designed, a book they wrote, a major gift they gave or financial security they&#39;ve achieved for their family. For others, it&#39;s accumulative: a long career at a business or university or in a specific field of endeavor where they will be remembered for changing the status quo. For still others, it&#39;s more personal and emotional - managing a family thru life&#39;s ups and downs or collecting wisdom and knowledge to be shared with future generations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A survey conducted by 60 Minutes and Vanity Fair explored how different people view &ldquo;immortality.&rdquo; Respondents were asked, &ldquo;Which would you like most to be named after you?&rdquo; Choices included a grandchild, a street in your hometown, and a pew in your church, a national holiday, or a rest stop along a highway. (Admittedly, not the only or even the best choices.) The most popular response &ndash; by far -- was a &ldquo;grandchild.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A legacy doesn&rsquo;t just have to happen to you. You have choices about that, too, if you don&rsquo;t wait too long to begin shaping it and defining it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some suggestions collected from experts about how to take stock of what matters most in your life and how to make sure others see it the same way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To think through what makes you unique, try one of these exercises:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Write the title and introduction of your (hypothetical) autobiography.</li>\r\n\t<li>Start a running list of your preferences in all categories you can think of: food, entertainment, politics, activities, friends, charitable causes. The list forms a composite profile of what makes you YOU.</li>\r\n\t<li>Write a new resume &ndash; but not just about the professional you. Include all the &ldquo;roles&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve managed and mastered in your life.</li>\r\n\t<li>Prepare the eulogy you&rsquo;d like to be delivered in celebration of your life.</li>\r\n\t<li>Interview yourself. Find an interview with a celebrity you think hits some important topics and ask yourself the same questions.</li>\r\n\t<li>When you&rsquo;re clear about how you&rsquo;d like your life to be interpreted, write it down. A letter to your children or best friend. A brief summary of your life story, complete with your life philosophy or lessons you&rsquo;ve learned. Even your own obituary. This exercise serves a double purpose. Putting your legacy in writing and giving it to someone you trust, improves the likelihood that others will see you in that light, too.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><small>Ref:-&nbsp;https://www.babyboomers.com/article/how-to-start-carving-out-your-unique-legacy-/5a44ee7ee4b0dcb99fe5f288</small></p>\r\n","time":"Tue Mar 30 2021 19:49:26 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)","image":"3c8id118nf_101001.jpg","__v":0}
